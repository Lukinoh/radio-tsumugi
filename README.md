**Tsumugi Radio are using a radio caster, it provide a good radio player. So I decide to not adapt this application. Hence, the application is now deprecated.**

To listen to the radio go to https://azuracast.mahoro-net.org/public/tsumugi

# Radio tsumugi

## Why  ?
I was listening the radio on the [offical website](https://tsumugi.forum-thalie.fr/) official or using Windows media player, but sometimes I wanted to have the name of the songs.
So I look at the endpoint they provide and decided to develop a small frontend for it.

## Information
To configure API you just have to create a config.json in the public folder with the good endpoint.

## TODO
- Deployment somewhere
- (optimal) Add tests...
- (optional) Maybe redux may be useful for sharing the state of the radio and the volume
- (optional) Custom typings for ReactFreeze should be declare more correctly
